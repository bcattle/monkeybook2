            Summary<br>We use your data to create special, personalized products for your purchase. <br><br>

            1. Information Collected

            We collect personal information when you register with MonkeyBook, also referred to as “the Site.” which is owned and operated by Voomza, Inc, a Delaware Corporation. Personal information is any information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address or phone number, Facebook Connect sign-in information (if applicable), and any other information that is not otherwise publicly available. If you order products or pay for services, we may need your shipping address, billing name and address, as well as the credit card number and expiration date.<br><br>

            You may access and use the Site solely for your personal, noncommercial use. Except as expressly authorized hereunder, the Site may not be reproduced, duplicated, copied, sold, resold, visited, reverse-engineered or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose without Voomza’s prior written authorization. We reserve the right to alter or discontinue the Site, in whole or in part, at any time in Voomza’s sole discretion.<br><br>
            2. Cookies

            Like many websites, we use cookies to collect anonymous visitor information. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser. They make it possible for us to store the contents of your shopping cart until you are ready to check out, recognize your browser when you visit and provide you with information about products that interest you.

            MonkeyBook’s share service allows you to create a special website and invite recipients to participate in that website. Our Share Service allows you to send an email invitation to your selected recipients, and then to allow them to view, save, or purchase products from your pictures. This invitation email would contain a web link created specifically for your pictures. The email also may include information about special promotional offers from MonkeyBook and/or carefully-screened third parties.<br><br>

            We use anonymous information, such as that pertaining to web pages you’ve viewed, in order to analyze trends, track user’s movements, provide a better website experience and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

            Restrict or inhibit any other user from using the Site, including, without limitation, by means of “hacking” or defacing any portion of the Sites;
            If we transfer information about you in the event that Voomza, Inc. or any of its family of companies, is acquired by, reorganized or merged with another company, you will have the opportunity to ask not to receive promotional information following any such event.<br><br>
